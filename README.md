* Typography
    * The font used was Roboto, with sans-serif set as a back up font. Roboto was used as it has an easy readibility and has a clean and modern design. 
* Imagery
    * The background image used was taken at the Wrexham AFC home ground and makes for a well suited background image. Also the Wrexham AFC badge was also added to follow the Wrexham theme.
